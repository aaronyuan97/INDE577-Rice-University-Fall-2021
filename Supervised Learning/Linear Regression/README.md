# Linear Regression
Many types of problems and data fall into this roughly linear relationship. For example, one could reasonably suspect that such a relationship exists when considering the iris dataset setosa species sepal length as feature measurements together with the iris dataset setosa species sepal width as targets. This can be verified by visualizing the data.

## Datasets
- Wine dataset  
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  

The attributes are (dontated by Riccardo Leardi, riclea '@' anchem.unige.it )
1) Alcohol  
2) Malic acid  
3) Ash  
4) Alcalinity of ash  
5) Magnesium  
6) Total phenols  
7) Flavanoids  
8) Nonflavanoid phenols  
9) Proanthocyanins  
10) Color intensity  
11) Hue  
12) OD280/OD315 of diluted wines  
13) Proline
