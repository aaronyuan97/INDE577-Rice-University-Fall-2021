# Perceptron
In machine learning, the Perceptron algorithm is a two-class (binary) classification algorithm. Binary classification is a form of classification, the process of predicting categorical variables, where the output is restricted to two classes, and it can be used in many data science field. It is a type of neural network model, perhaps the simplest type of neural network model. It consists of a single node or neuron that takes a row of data as input and predicts a class label.
