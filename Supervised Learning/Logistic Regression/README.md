# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. Logistic regression can be a useful analysis method for classifiction problems,where you are trying to determine if a new sample fits best into a category. As aspects of cyber security are classification problems, such as attack detection, logistic regression is a useful analytic technique.
