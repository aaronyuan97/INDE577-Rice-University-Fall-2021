# Ensemble learning  
Ensemble methods are machine learning methods that aggregate the predictions of a group of base learners in order to form a single learning model. For example, imagine that each person in this video is a trained machine learning model and notice the average of their predictions is a much more accurate prediction that the individual predictions. In this lecture we will consider two types of ensemble concepts and methods. Namely,  
- Bagging

- Random Forests  

## Ensemble Boosting
**Boosting** is an ensemble method that trains predictors sequentially, each trying to correct the errors made by the previous predictor. In this lecture we consider two well known boosting methods, namely **AdaBoost** and **gradient boosting**.

## Datasets
- The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman.  
The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization.datasets contain data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Packages
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn
